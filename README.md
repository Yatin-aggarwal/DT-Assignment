<h1>Student Evaluation Dashboard – A Holistic Assessment Approach</h1>
All tasks were completed as per the given instructions, and the final dashboard was successfully created. The dashboard includes student names, basic test scores, advanced test scores, ranks, feedback, and suggestions.

In the given assignment, merely assigning marks to each option does not fully capture the diverse criteria on which a student can be evaluated. To gain a deeper understanding of their perspective and strengths, I have assessed each option based on five key criteria:
<ui>
  <li> Risk-taking (Adventurousness) – The willingness to step out of one’s comfort zone.</li>
  <li>Self-learning – The ability to acquire knowledge independently.</li>
  <li>Sense of Achievement – The drive to set and accomplish meaningful goals.</li>
  <li>Cross-functional Thinking – The ability to connect ideas across different domains.</li>
  <li>Ability to Take Feedback – Openness to constructive criticism and improvement.</li>
</ul>

Based on this assessment, we have provided additional feedback and suggestions to foster growth while reducing unhealthy competition.
